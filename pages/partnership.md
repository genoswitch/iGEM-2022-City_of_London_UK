### Our ongoing partnership with King’s College London

Our prime partner in this endeavour is the King’s College London Team. Building on our strong history of partnership, this year we initiated contact early into our design cycle to glean advice and opinions on our potential projects. The conversations that we had helped inform us of the challenges that each idea would present, leading to a fully informed decision of going forwards with aLFA REMASK. At this point, our design cycle was ahead of their schedule and so our insights focussed on the experiences and understandings that our leadership team had found from working on our 2021 team project.

Later in our work with them, we were able to get to the point where we could provide good feedback for their brilliant idea; helping them understand what our concerns, as ‘lay people’, would be. This initiated a period of their education and communication about their ideas, similarly following our creation of the CLS iGEM instagram page.

The main aspect of our work with the team, however, was undeniably through our joint education programmes. Beyond the integrated feedback given to our project, we were able to create surveys and questionnaires for students at our school about their understanding of synthetic biology and how they would react to using it in their everyday lives. The insights that we gained from this, we shared with KCL to further help both of our integrated human practices programmes. We learnt that the vast majority of young people had little understanding of what genetic engineering was, and how to get started in STEM. So immediately we worked on multiple newspaper articles that were published for free to over 3,000 recipients about iGEM, our ideas, how to get started in synthetic biology, and how it is possible to be a part of this culture with skillsets focussed on business, communication, and non-STEM subjects.

This collaboration was so successful that within a range of weeks, we started receiving emails and communications from students as young as 13 years old, asking if they could join our team and be a part of our new approach to science. For us, it showed that we were doing the right thing and that we should push forward to achieve more. So, in a similar vein, we had the gumption to use the City of London School Future Guidance team, the group who help all students decide on their futures (and help them get there!), to promote Science Mind Magazine, a quarterly publication from Kings College focussing on big news and important discoveries in STEM. This magazine was promoted to students as young as Year 6, for free, to get people more interested and invested in the work of iGEM and similar organisations.

But we knew deep down that, despite the intense success of our work in CLS, we could do more to further the understanding of everything that our teams do. So we doubled down on demystifying iGEM and synthetic biology with two main ideas. Firstly, with the creation of our respective podcasts, we created episodes in which the leaders spoke about their experiences of what it means to lead a group working in such a novel environment. Our questions ranged from how to start an iGEM team, to how to manage the setbacks that always happen with a team of this nature. Allowing us to publish these to people outside of our extensive organisations meant that we could directly have an impact on people who even passively were interested in science.

Our biggest achievement with Kings College, however, was arguably the tailor made synthetic biology education sessions that we created for young students at City of London School for Girls. Alongside our own sessions created, the partnership that we utilised allowed us to bring the perspective of the students who would receive the education, and the understanding of how best to present to them, with the world class knowledge base of the university. These were able to be sent off to CLSG for Autumn term implementation; our hope being that the work that we have done inspires students to be more confident in their assertions of being interested in science, allowing their confidence to push them into new fields of study that currently under-represent a fair composition of men and women.
