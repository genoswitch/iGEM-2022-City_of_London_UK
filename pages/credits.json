She has shown herself to be a highly astute and diligent scientist - as well as the most demanding of leaders. Spending many hours perusing through peer-reviewed journals and designing gRNAs, while simultaneously ordering others to do the same - her role in research has been invaluable, as has her unwavering commitment to the team. Alongside leading the Biology Team, she has been liaising with CLSG finances and technicians to ensure maximum involvement from the girls' school. It has been the greatest honour and privilege to have worked alongside her, and we apologise for the bedtimes lost."
