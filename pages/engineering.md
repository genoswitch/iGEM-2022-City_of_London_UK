Our design cycle for bacterial lysis was greatly important to our project. Being the first, and most novel step, we had to make sure that the hardware worked every time and was compatible with the biological requirements so that the rest of the triage could take place. The most fundamental aspect of this was specifically how the heating of the chamber was to be sufficient enough to lyse bacterial samples. For this, as we detail below, we had to change the shape of the lysis chamber in order to maximise even temperature distribution. Similarly we changed the very nature of how heating would occur - from chemically to electrically. Once we had established the mechanism of heating, and how this would be incorporated into our mask, we tested the conditions that would be achieved by the chamber on bacterial samples of Lactobacillus Casei; successfully showing that our solution would indeed perform as required. The information below goes through this entire process.

## Our Preliminary Hardware Design Cycle

The first and foremost concern we had when considering constructing such a mask was one of energy. Simply put, could we store enough energy on the mask to safely heat the sample for an hour at 65 degrees.
To start with, we considered an exothermic chemical reaction (such as that of calcium oxide and water) within the mask as a means of generating the heat required. The benefits of such an approach were its ease of use, high energy density and relatively low cost. However, it also posed many challenges we considered too tough to pursue. Firstly, there were the biological implications of having such a reaction occur at the same time as lysis, and more importantly the issue of maintaining a constant temperature for an extended period of time. Therefore, the chemical solution to this problem was soon abandoned
The other more obvious approach (and the one we have opted for) was to electrically heat the sample. While we did initially have concerns regarding the energy required for this, some rough ideal capacity calculations indicated that a consumer button cell was theoretically up to the task, and we went about developing a model to confirm this (see model). Our testing, detailed in the hardware section itself, showed beyond doubt that we could achieve 65 degrees celsius for over 80 minutes. This then allowed us to progress into the biological aspect of our testing.

## Our Biological Experimental Design Cycle

In order to procure the necessary samples to show the occurrence of cellular lysis by heat, several changes were made to our initial gram-staining protocol. Instead of air fixing our bacteria to the slide as instructed, through trial and error, we concluded that heat-fixing the sample using the bunsen flame would provide a far more discernible sample under the microscope. While the baseline image at room temperature taken before heating shows the presence of single cells and even chain formation after 40 minutes of heating - by 80 mins of incubation, change in morphology with disruption of the chain formation and increased debris indicated increased bacterial lysis.

Unfortunately this year, our labs underwent extensive renovation work to promote STEM subjects to younger students, and to commit to sustainability of projects like this in the future. Consequently, for a long period of time during the summer and autumn our team was unable to make use of its full potential and as a result, our access to BSL-2 organisms like the intended mycobacterium smegmatis was curtailed. Further, the UK guidelines were particularly vague about the usage of M. Smegmatis and thus we had to spend a significant period trying to clarify the laws with the legislature. This resulted in successful clarification and permittance to use the bacteria given specific conditions stipulated by the CLEAPSS organisation; these were unable to be fulfilled within the remaining time due to budget and locational restraints intrinsic to being a school situated in the centre of London. This meant we had to rely upon bacterial strains of the lactobacillus family. We were fully aware, however, that these would not be perfect model organisms as they have a far higher heat shock potential than the ideal model organism, Mycobacterium Smegmatis. This invariably resulted in procuring data that would be less positive than if we had used a different strain. However, the fact that we were able to demonstrate the promotion of lysis in L. Casei, in such a short period of time, clearly showed that M. Smegmatis (and, invariably, M. Tuberculosis) would be lysed in a shorter period of time. It is easily stipulated from our results that had we used M. smegmatis, heat lysis would have certainly occurred after 80 minutes at 65C; further validating our hypothesis of one-hour lysis.
