# Collaborations

---

Collaboration is not only at the heart of iGEM, but of our culture in the City of London iGEM team. Being the only high school in the United Kingdom that partakes, and the first in Europe to compete, every year we are placed in the unique position of performing with a small budget and with a team and is new to genetic engineering. This deficit, however, is made up entirely through our collaboration with the other brilliant teams in the UK.

## International and Multi-team Collaborations:

We understand that true collaboration requires marrying multiple opinions and ethoses to try to ascertain the truth. And so, we naturally recognise that true collaboration requires many different inputs from teams across the country and across the globe.

To get this, we joined the High School Synthetic Biology initiative set up by the iGEM community itself. This allowed us to not only present our ideas to people with vastly different experiences to ourselves, but to understand what the challenges of rolling out our product across the globe may be. This ongoing opportunity meant that we began to understand the importance of reducing prices when in an international market. This, alongside our more direct outreach, led our focus to being one with much more weight on reducing costs through increasing efficiency in production. The main price decrease in this endeavour was our shift towards 3D printing and reduction in the complexity of each individual lateral flow element so that batch printing, and single-print production could be employed.

Beyond our design cycle and integrated human practices, however, we knew that our pitch and how you present a product in the real world can make a massive difference to how well it is received and, in turn, the impact that it can have. With our clear aim of maximising impact, we also made sure that we could make this aspect possible. To that end we were part of the UK wide iGEM team meet-up at Imperial College where we learnt first hand the best way to present and be able to make a great impact with our product - we hope to show this off in person at the Jamboree. We also knew that the sustainability of our team would be best improved by making sure that leaders of this year's project, and next year's team, could present an idea succinctly and in a captivating manner. So we attended the Team Presentation Workshop with Keynote Speaker Elaine Powell to make sure that this was achieved.

## Working with University College London

Alongside KCL, UCL is one of our cultural twins with its campus at the heart of Central London. In a celebration of this, we worked together to provide feedback on our individual ideas in order to better integrate opinions of people linked closely to wide hospital organisations into our design. This led to our product further being improved through its primer design to increase specificity in order to make this a reliable triage truly possible to be implemented in the real world.
