# Part Contribution

---

Several parts on the iGEM registry related to our project were researched and upon realising that many were lacking in content, we transcribed any information that we had learned throughout the course of the year from study of scientific literature.
Additionally, new parts have been designed by the City of London 2022 Team and added to the registry.
