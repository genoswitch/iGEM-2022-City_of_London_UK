# Part Contribution

---

Several parts on the iGEM registry related to our project were researched and upon realising that many were lacking in content, we transcribed any information that we had learned throughout the course of the year from study of scientific literature.
Additionally, new parts have been designed by the City of London 2022 Team and added to the registry.

New additions to the BioBrick registry include forward and reverse primers for Heat shock protein 65 (HSP65) and GroEL2. We hope that any future teams wishing to amplify these genes may refer to our documented parts. Also, our contribution to existing parts page on Cas12a and its use in a sequential system consisting of recombinase polymerase amplification and LFA output, will also help to inform succeeding teams about the uses of various CRISPR variants.
