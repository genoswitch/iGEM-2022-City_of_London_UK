# Outreach
Among our Human Practices team, outreach has been a fundamental aspect of our project journey. Being able to talk and engage with professionals of their field has allowed for the integration of a multitude of synthetic biological techniques in order to create the most sustainable and effective diagnostic tool. Outreach has played an immensely important role in our research and how we could logistically implement our project into society. Speaking with consultants, physicians and researchers has allowed for us to understand where in the world we could best promote our project and why it would be able to replace other diagnostic tools. We have been able to build our knowledge in synthetic biology through outreach and collectively move through the process of our design cycle. 

Through our design cycle we have omitted and introduced different synthetic biological tools in order to be the most cost effective, sustainable and realistic in our approach towards creating a wearable diagnostic tool. By talking with these professionals allowed for the approach towards integrated human practices and bettering our project.

Kim Payne is a teaching associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh for the department of biological sciences. She has a research background in Molecular Biology and Virology and with specific experience in studying mycobacteriophages and Herpes Simplex Virus type 1. 

After talking with Kim Payne we were given feedback about the use of the enzymes within our mask. She gave us insight about the processes necessary for lysis via enzymes and how this could be possible through different synthetic biological methods. However, this led us to the decision of not using enzymes. This decision shows and emulates a perfect example of integrated human practices where we accounted for guidance given by an external source, in this case being a researcher in the field of molecular biology.

Dr Simon Tiberi is an honorary consultant physician in infectious diseases at Barts Health NHS Trust and at Queen Mary University of London. He works in Infections and Tuberculosis clinics in East London Hospitals and is also TB secretary for the European Respiratory Society. Much of his research is focused on mycobacteria, respiratory infections and antimicrobials, and he is involved in many clinical trials, translational and health service research. 

Having spoken to Dr Tiberi we were able to understand the expanse of Tuberculosis across the United Kingdom. He enlightened us with the knowledge that not only was Tuberculosis common and prevalent in developing countries but also a very prominent and serious issue in England. In 2020, 4,125 individuals were diagnosed with Tuberculosis in England, and around a rate of 7.3 for every 100,000 people. Once we had assimilated this information we were yet to realise how vital this was for us to pursue within our project.

### Dr Peter Nguyen:

Dr Peter Nguyen currently works on programmable probiotics and freeze-dried cell-free manufacturing technology at the Wyss Institute. He also researched engineering systems for the self-assembly and control of nanoscale structures which include protein engineering for synthetic biology. He is in the process of creating and developing wearable diagnostics through synthetic biology and the use of freeze-dried biological circuits. 

Dr Nguyen had already researched and came up with the idea of a wearable diagnostic tool - a mask, that would be able to detect and diagnose viral infections. This was the idea that sparked our focal interest in a wearable diagnostic method and we decided to then implement this into another realm of healthcare and diagnosis which we chose as Tuberculosis. From Dr Nguyen’s idea we changed and evolved his design to fit our goals and aims for how the mask would operate. We created a new thermal lysis system and RPA system. Dr Nguyen however, has helped us tremendously in the process of our design cycle; through the development of the lateral flow test strip, how we would cut and arrange it, and how we would be able to assemble the parts of the mask. His input and advisory skills have pushed our project to where it is and this would be seen as an example of integrated human practices. We wholeheartedly reflected on the feedback we received and this overall helped us to better understand the parts of our project we needed to improve. As a previous iGEM participant himself we valued his input greatly.

### Oliver Stringer:

Oliver Stringer is a postgraduate researcher for the Faculty of Medicine, Department of Infectious Disease at Imperial College London. His research includes human and veterinary based pathogens with a core focus on diagnostic methods. He also has experience of working with traditional PCR and isothermal amplification techniques.

We were given feedback from Oliver Stringer that enabled us to understand the benefits and weaknesses of working with and using RPA in our mask. His knowledge on designing RPA probes were of great benefit to us and helped us to decipher the methods and techniques in which we would want to go about this. He applauded us with great commendation about our ability to work with RPA at low temperatures which made it fast and simplistic. 

### Dr David Rueda:

Dr David Rueda is currently the Chair in Molecular and Cellular Biophysics within the Faculty of Medicine, Department of Infectious Disease at Imperial College London. His research consists of developing and applying single molecule approaches to understand the mechanisms by which protein and nucleic acids regulate cellular functions such as DNA replication and repair. 

Through speaking with Dr Rueda, he helped us learn about the importance of CRISPR in our mask as a synthetic biological component. He helped us understand the benefits and challenges towards using CRISPR and how we could implement an efficient approach within our mask. He validated the fact that we were going to be using this method of CRISPR, and so this was very much taken on board as an important aspect to factor in competely for the mask.

### Seda Yerlikaya:

Seda Yerlikaya works with the Tuberculosis foundation and also works with the Find Diagnosis for all foundation where they interconnect countries, healthcare facilities and funding to aid with diagnosis for diseases around the world. They try to improve healthcare systems and implement sustainability where possible in terms of cost and realism.

We managed to get into contact with Seda Yerlikaya very early on in our design cycle where we first came up with our idea for the mask. She was able to give us an insight into how prevalent and the disease of tuberculosis was and how much money were spent on tests for diagnosis. This highlighted to us that we massively needed to tackle this and make an impact on the diagnostic tools and methods available. We also learnt about the lack of knowledge about Tuberculosis as a disease to the public and the world in general. We decided to act on this to improve the education on Tuberculosis in our wider society, which we deem as exceptionally important for us to be aware about the implications of this disease. 

### Professor Andrew Martin:

Professor Andrew Martin is a Professor of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology and UCL. He takes particular interest in the sequence, structure and function of antibodies and also the impact of mutations on protein structure and function. He has also acted as a consultant to many pharmaceutical companies and teaches about protein energetics, protein folding and antibody structure. 

When we had spoken to Professor Andrew Martin at the very beginning of our design cycle, he aided us in understanding the potential for using custom made proteins which would allow us to detect tuberculosis or a multitude of other diseases. However, after learning about the synthetic biological processes and techniques our project would have to undergo, we came to the conclusion that this would not be possible for us to. This being a prime example of integrated human practise where we took on the advice from Professor Andrew Martin about custom made proteins and our limited ability to be able to pursue this. 

# Education in CLS/G

We had the opportunity to give assemblies to students across both City of London Boys’, and City of London Girls’ schools. This spanned across all year groups ranging from ages 11-18. The assemblies allowed us to introduce the iGEM competition to younger students so they could have a better understanding of what it involves. We also raised awareness on the issue of tuberculosis across the world, which helped us to introduce our project idea in a simplified manner to show them the potential benefits that an iGEM project can have. One of our key points was to emphasise that iGEM can be a lot more than just Biology and Chemistry, and that students with different interests such as economics and philosophy can also contribute and really enjoy taking part. 

Our two schools both publish weekly newspapers, in which we have written multiple articles about iGEM, and our project. The first was a deep dive into our project, including the mechanism of action and explanation of each physical and biological element of the mask. Second, was our project against the wider background of iGEM, explaining principles of synthetic biology and the multidisciplinary way in which the competition thrives. Our collaboration with King’s College London also featured, explaining the advantages of such teamwork through the sharing of facilities, knowledge and experiences to both iGEM teams.

We worked with an organisation called IntoUniversity, educating young children (primary school ages) about genetic engineering in small group classes. Naturally, the result after a handful of lessons was a bombardment of questions and creative ideas from the children that no doubt would make great iGEM participants. A big emphasis for us in these lessons was pointing out the number of routes there are into iGEM and in a more general sense, STEM. This revealed to them the opportunities they may have in the future to spend time involved with STEM subjects whether it be at home, school, or in the more distant future of work.  We made online content too, for the wider access of anyone across the world with internet access, to introduce the concept of genetic engineering in a simple way that still ensures a complete understanding of the discipline, where we also highlighted the variety of pathways into STEM.



# Collaborations
Collaboration is not only at the heart of iGEM, but of our culture in the City of London iGEM team. Being the only high school in the United Kingdom that partakes, and the first in Europe to compete, every year we are placed in the unique position of performing with a small budget and with a team and is new to genetic engineering. This deficit, however, is made up entirely through our collaboration with the other brilliant teams in the UK. 


### Our ongoing partnership with King’s College London
Our prime partner in this endeavour is the King’s College London Team. Building on our strong history of partnership, this year we initiated contact early into our design cycle to glean advice and opinions on our potential projects. The conversations that we had helped inform us of the challenges that each idea would present, leading to a fully informed decision of going forwards with aLFA REMASK. At this point, our design cycle was ahead of their schedule and so our insights focussed on the experiences and understandings that our leadership team had found from working on our 2021 team project. 

![](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4508/wiki/hp/kcl-zoom-call.png)

Later in our work with them, we were able to get to the point where we could provide good feedback for their brilliant idea; helping them understand what our concerns, as ‘lay people’, would be. This initiated a period of their education and communication about their ideas, similarly following our creation of the CLS iGEM instagram page.

The main aspect of our work with the team, however, was undeniably through our joint education programmes. Beyond the integrated feedback given to our project, we were able to create surveys and questionnaires for students at our school about their understanding of synthetic biology and how they would react to using it in their everyday lives. The insights that we gained from this, we shared with KCL to further help both of our integrated human practices programmes. We learnt that the vast majority of young people had little understanding of what genetic engineering was, and how to get started in STEM. So immediately we worked on multiple newspaper articles that were published for free to over 3,000 recipients about iGEM, our ideas, how to get started in synthetic biology, and how it is possible to be a part of this culture with skillsets focussed on business, communication, and non-STEM subjects. 

![](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4508/wiki/hp/citizen-article.jpeg)


This collaboration was so successful that within a range of weeks, we started receiving emails and communications from students as young as 13 years old, asking if they could join our team and be a part of our new approach to science. For us, it showed that we were doing the right thing and that we should push forward to achieve more. So, in a similar vein, we had the gumption to use the City of London School Future Guidance team, the group who help all students decide on their futures (and help them get there!), to promote Science Mind Magazine, a quarterly publication from Kings College focussing on big news and important discoveries in STEM. This magazine was promoted to students as young as Year 6, for free, to get people more interested and invested in the work of iGEM and similar organisations.

But we knew deep down that, despite the intense success of our work in CLS, we could do more to further the understanding of everything that our teams do. So we doubled down on demystifying iGEM and synthetic biology with two main ideas. Firstly, with the creation of our respective podcasts, we created episodes in which the leaders spoke about their experiences of what it means to lead a group working in such a novel environment. Our questions ranged from how to start an iGEM team, to how to manage the setbacks that always happen with a team of this nature. Allowing us to publish these to people outside of our extensive organisations meant that we could directly have an impact on people who even passively were interested in science. 

Our biggest achievement with Kings College, however, was arguably the tailor made synthetic biology education sessions that we created for young students at City of London School for Girls. Alongside our own sessions created, the partnership that we utilised allowed us to bring the perspective of the students who would receive the education, and the understanding of how best to present to them, with the world class knowledge base of the university. These were able to be sent off to CLSG for Autumn term implementation; our hope being that the work that we have done inspires students to be more confident in their assertions of being interested in science, allowing their confidence to push them into new fields of study that currently under-represent a fair composition of men and women. 



### International and Multi-team Collaborations:
We understand that true collaboration requires marrying multiple opinions and ethoses to try to ascertain the truth. And so, we naturally recognise that true collaboration requires many different inputs from teams across the country and across the globe.

To get this, we joined the High School Synthetic Biology initiative set up by the iGEM community itself. This allowed us to not only present our ideas to people with vastly different experiences to ourselves, but to understand what the challenges of rolling out our product across the globe may be. This ongoing opportunity meant that we began to understand the importance of reducing prices when in an international market. This, alongside our more direct outreach, led our focus to being one with much more weight on reducing costs through increasing efficiency in production. The main price decrease in this endeavour was our shift towards 3D printing and reduction in the complexity of each individual lateral flow element so that batch printing, and single-print production could be employed. 

Beyond our design cycle and integrated human practices, however, we knew that our pitch and how you present a product in the real world can make a massive difference to how well it is received and, in turn, the impact that it can have. With our clear aim of maximising impact, we also made sure that we could make this aspect possible. To that end we were part of the UK wide iGEM team meet-up at Imperial College where we learnt first hand the best way to present and be able to make a great impact with our product - we hope to show this off in person at the Jamboree. We also knew that the sustainability of our team would be best improved by making sure that leaders of this year's project, and next year's team, could present an idea succinctly and in a captivating manner. So we attended the Team Presentation Workshop with Keynote Speaker Elaine Powell to make sure that this was achieved. 


### Working with University College London
Alongside KCL, UCL is one of our cultural twins with its campus at the heart of Central London. In a celebration of this, we worked together to provide feedback on our individual ideas in order to better integrate opinions of people linked closely to wide hospital organisations into our design. This led to our product further being improved through its primer design to increase specificity in order to make this a reliable triage truly possible to be implemented in the real world.  


# Podcast
Starting a team podcast was a great opportunity for us to share different aspects of our IGEM project with the broader community. Our podcast series had a total of X episodes covering a broad range of topics from discussion of the importance of inclusivity and diversity in STEM to a detailed explanation of the biology of our aLFA REMASK. Team members worked in pairs or threes to make the episode content and film their podcast episodes. The opportunity to engage with the broader community through the podcast, rather than traditional written content, allowed our team to build a stronger connection with other IGEM teams, professionals, and our school community.
