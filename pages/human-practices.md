# Education in CLS/G

We had the opportunity to give assemblies to students across both City of London Boys’, and City of London Girls’ schools. This spanned across all year groups ranging from ages 11-18. The assemblies allowed us to introduce the iGEM competition to younger students so they could have a better understanding of what it involves. We also raised awareness on the issue of tuberculosis across the world, which helped us to introduce our project idea in a simplified manner to show them the potential benefits that an iGEM project can have. One of our key points was to emphasise that iGEM can be a lot more than just Biology and Chemistry, and that students with different interests such as economics and philosophy can also contribute and really enjoy taking part.

Our two schools both publish weekly newspapers, in which we have written multiple articles about iGEM, and our project. The first was a deep dive into our project, including the mechanism of action and explanation of each physical and biological element of the mask. Second, was our project against the wider background of iGEM, explaining principles of synthetic biology and the multidisciplinary way in which the competition thrives. Our collaboration with King’s College London also featured, explaining the advantages of such teamwork through the sharing of facilities, knowledge and experiences to both iGEM teams.

We worked with an organisation called IntoUniversity, educating young children (primary school ages) about genetic engineering in small group classes. Naturally, the result after a handful of lessons was a bombardment of questions and creative ideas from the children that no doubt would make great iGEM participants. A big emphasis for us in these lessons was pointing out the number of routes there are into iGEM and in a more general sense, STEM. This revealed to them the opportunities they may have in the future to spend time involved with STEM subjects whether it be at home, school, or in the more distant future of work. We made online content too, for the wider access of anyone across the world with internet access, to introduce the concept of genetic engineering in a simple way that still ensures a complete understanding of the discipline, where we also highlighted the variety of pathways into STEM.

# Podcast

---

Starting a team podcast was a great opportunity for us to share different aspects of our IGEM project with the broader community. Our podcast series had a total of X episodes covering a broad range of topics from discussion of the importance of inclusivity and diversity in STEM to a detailed explanation of the biology of our aLFA REMASK. Team members worked in pairs or threes to make the episode content and film their podcast episodes. The opportunity to engage with the broader community through the podcast, rather than traditional written content, allowed our team to build a stronger connection with other IGEM teams, professionals, and our school community.
